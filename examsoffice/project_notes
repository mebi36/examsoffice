Project update todo
    - re-do entire look and feel of app
        what a frontend framework will help solve:
            - handle icons, conditional rendering of components, reactivity, ease implementation of charts,
                make project future-proof
            - difficulties in using fontend: the project is download-heavy, backend generates lots of files,
                a lot of work has gone into the backend-dependent design, 
            - progress plan: progressively add vue/ re-do entire project to have a decoupled frontend/backend 
                structure.

======================================================
Possible new Features
    - implementation of groups and permissions: only a  certain group of staff should be allowed to    modify results and a group with higher clearance must be able to view all the modifications made
    in the system. - a logging system may also be
    necessary ***critical feature
    
    - student performance detail view: current cgpa/ possible class 
        degree, position in class, etc (picture of student)
    - entire class performance detail view: highest cgpa, number of 
        students in different classes of degree
    - view that displays students in a class, outstanding courses/  
        unit load
    - view that displays list of possible graduands for a particular
        year (use analytics to give insights)
    - view that displays all the results for a course in a given
        academic session, makes it possible to edit any record and
        synch changes to the backend

vue should be the last resort for anything being implemented
        add
            cgpa calculator =done
            outstanding courses = done
            result breakdown(a's, b's) = done
            best semester/session performance 
        methods to models files

        make an academicset class for manipulating results of students in the
        same graduation set,
            class average grades for a particular course,
            highest/lowest cgpa in a class
            class ranking by cgpa

==============================================================================
Project data modeling needs to improve:
                Lecturer/Student models need to become robust enough for multi-department
                    relations. The system does not understand the concept of departments:
                    this is a significant rudimentary flaw in the design concept. 

===============================
There could be a popover for courses with no passing grades section with information
such as how many times student has attempted a course and the sessions they attempted it.
